TODO:
 - every testcase file should be renamed.(rename their testcases also?)
 - No file should be in any subfolder
 - EVERY FILE (except maybe grammar.txt) should have group details in comment-form at the top.
 - Write a bunch of more testcases, and for big testcases write the number of lines as file suffix.
